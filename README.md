# Federal Grant Reporting Project

## Background

The Federal Grant Reporting (FGR) Project is sponsored by the GSA [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services)'s [10x team](https://10x.gsa.gov). 10x helps turn ideas from federal employees into real projects that improve the experience people have with our government through technology. [The 10x process](https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/) incubates these ideas through a series of stages: Investigation, Discovery, Development, and Scale. The FGR project has reached the third stage.

## Phase I: Investigation

The first phase of this project consisted of in-depth user research, including direct observation of a grant report submission process and the receipt and analysis of submitted reports.

## Phase II: Discovery

During the second phase, the team broadened its focus to an analysis of the grant reporting actions shared by the majority of federal grantees, the data standards development work happening across the federal government, and the opportunities to improve related systems and processes for agencies and auditors. During this phase, the team also prototyped several proofs of concept for reducing the reporting burden for federal grant recipients.

## Phase III: Development

Working in conjunction with a partner agency, the team will develop an initial prototype into a minimum viable product (MVP) focused on improving the grant reporting experience for grants managers or grantees at the federal level. This work will be informed by and in conversation with the ongoing data standards work taking place across the federal government.
