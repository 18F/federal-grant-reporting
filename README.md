# Federal Grant Reporting Project

## Background

The Federal Grant Reporting (FGR) Project is sponsored by the GSA [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services)'s [10x team](https://10x.gsa.gov). 10x helps turn ideas from federal employees into real projects that improve the experience people have with our government through technology. [The 10x process](https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/) incubates these ideas through a series of stages: Investigation, Discovery, Development, and Scale. The FGR project has reached the third stage.

## Phase I: Investigation

This was a sprint to identify opportunities to improve the federal grant reporting process — by eliminating redundancies and creating efficiencies through improved technology — that could be adapted across federal programs, thereby increasing federal grant programs' efficacy to those being served as well as taxpayers' return on investment.
