# Federal Grant Reporting Project
Enabling simpler, faster, easier, better resolution of single audit findings by
agencies and grantees alike.

The 10x Federal Grant Reporting project is building a prospective shared solution for specific touchpoints along the single audit finding resolution process to provides easier access to audit data. For up to date information about this project see the project [readme](https://github.com/18F/federal-grant-reporting/blob/master/README.md) This stands to help auditors, grant managers, and agency CFOs as well as grantees.

## How can you help?

**Federal granting agency**
If you're someone who works with single audits at a federal agency, we're interested in speaking with you.

**Independent auditors**
If you're someone who's worked on single audits, we're interested in talking with you and better understanding your current process and any pain points around creating audits and adding them to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

## Background

The Federal Grant Reporting (FGR) project has been funded by the GSA [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services)'s [10x team](https://10x.gsa.gov). 10x helps turn ideas from federal employees into real projects that improve the experience people have with our government through technology. [The 10x process](https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/) incubates these ideas through a series of stages: Investigation, Discovery, Development, and Scale. The Federal Grant Reporting project has reached the third stage and is under active development.

## Phase I: Investigation

The first phase of this project consisted of in-depth user research, including direct observation of a grant report submission process and the receipt and analysis of submitted reports.

## Phase II: Discovery

During the second phase, the team broadened its focus to an analysis of the grant reporting actions shared by the majority of federal grantees, the data standards development work happening across the federal government, and the opportunities to improve related systems and processes for agencies and auditors. During this phase, the team also prototyped several proofs of concept for reducing the reporting burden for federal grant recipients.

## Phase III: Development

The team is building out two minimum viable products (MVPs) focused on improving the single audit finding resolution experience for federal grant managers and grantees. This work is informed by and in conversation with several agencies as well as the ongoing data standards work taking place across the federal government.
