# Field inventories

These field inventories were downloaded from the
[Common Data Elements Repository](https://repository.usaspending.gov/cder_library/authorized/forms)
(CDER) in April 2019.

We've included them here so that we can identify overlapping/recurring fields,
which indicate opportunities to streamline processes and reduce reporting burden.

The inventories include, in order of chronological appearance in the grant cycle:
 * The SF-424: Request for Funding
 * The SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement
 * The SF-425, Federal Financial Report (FFR)

They do not include the following, which are not yet available through CDER:
 * The SAM API's fields and
 * The Federal Audit Clearinghouse's fields.

We can use other means to include those soon. Also note that multiple variants
of the SF-424 and the SF-425 exist.

### Further context

SAM.gov is, among other things, where prospective grantees are required to
register before they can apply for grants.

(And did you know? `SF` stands for `Standard Form`.)
